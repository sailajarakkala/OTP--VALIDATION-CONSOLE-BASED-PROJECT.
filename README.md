# OTP Validation Console-Based Project  

This is a Python-based OTP (One-Time Password) validation system using email. The script generates a random OTP and sends it to predefined email addresses for authentication. Users must enter the received OTP to complete verification.  

## Features  
- Generates a secure 4-digit OTP.  
- Sends OTP via email using the `smtplib` module.  
- Validates user-entered OTP against the generated OTP.  
- Uses Gmail SMTP for email transmission.  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following before running the script:  
- Python installed (3.x recommended).  
- Enable **Less Secure Apps** or use an **App Password** for Gmail SMTP.  
- Internet connection for sending emails.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```  
2. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install smtplib email
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Update the script with your Gmail credentials and recipient email addresses.  
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python otp_validation.py
   ```  
3. Enter the received OTP when prompted.  

## Security Note  
- **Do not hardcode your email credentials** in the script. Use environment variables for better security.  
- Use **App Passwords** instead of your main email password for authentication.
